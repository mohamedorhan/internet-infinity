# Internet ∞ (Infinity Internet) — Overview

Internet ∞ represents a paradigm shift in global networking.  
It integrates **GreenNet (eco-sustainable routing)**, **Quantum Internet**, **Cosmic Substrate**, **NeuralNet**, **HoloNet**, and **BioNet** into one unified stack.

### Core Principles
- 🌱 **Eco-Friendly**: Energy-aware routing with sustainability metrics.
- 🔮 **Quantum-Secure**: Entanglement-based communication resistant to eavesdropping.
- 🌌 **Cosmic Integration**: Extends networking beyond Earth, into interplanetary and interstellar scales.
- 🧠 **Neural Intelligence**: Adaptive learning for routing and optimization.
- 🕸️ **Holographic Connectivity**: High-density, multi-perspective data sharing.
- 🧬 **Bio-Symbiotic Interface**: Biocompatible nodes for direct human–machine integration.

### Goals
- Deliver **Internet 3.0**: a network that is **faster, safer, greener, unbreakable, and universal**.
- Provide a platform for research, innovation, and next-generation applications.
