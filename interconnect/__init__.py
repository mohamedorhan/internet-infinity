Interconnect Package
====================
Core Layer Implementations for the Internet Infinity Project (Internet ∞).

This package provides the fundamental building blocks for a next-generation 
networking paradigm that integrates multiple futuristic layers, including:

    - 🌱 GreenNet: Environmentally sustainable, secure routing layer.
    - 🔮 QuantumInternet: Entanglement-based communication and QKD security.
    - 🌌 CosmicSubstrate: Interplanetary and interstellar substrate for data transfer.
    - 🧠 NeuralNet: Adaptive, learning-based intelligent networking.
    - 🕸️ HoloNet: Holographic and spatial communication interface.
    - 🧬 BioNet: Bio-digital integration layer for biological signal networks.
    - 🌐 LegacyBridge: Compatibility layer bridging classical Internet (Web 2.0/3.0).

The `interconnect` package is the foundational research framework 
of the Internet ∞ initiative, serving as a proof-of-concept for 
Internet 3.0 and beyond.
